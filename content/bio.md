I will join Nanjing University as an incoming PhD student in Fall 2026, advised by [Prof. Guanghui Zhu](https://cs.nju.edu.cn/zgh/).
Prior to this, I obtained an M.Sc. in Software Engineering under the supervision of [Prof. Yafei Li](https://zzudb.github.io), and a B.Eng. in Mechanical Engineering from Zhengzhou University.

My current research focuses on the training and fine-tuning of large language models,  including learning, adaptation, reasoning, and generalization. I am also interested in reinforcement learning and preference-based learning methods, particularly for improving alignment, robustness, and adaptation in complex decision-making systems. I am open to research collaborations related to these areas of interest.
